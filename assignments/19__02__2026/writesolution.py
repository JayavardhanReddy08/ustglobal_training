1.why we didnt call local variable outside the function
Local variables are created inside a function and destroyed after the function execution completes.
2.where do we use map filter reduce function
map()function we use to every element in an iterable and returns a new modified iterable.
filter()Selects elements from an iterable based on a condition and returns only matching elements.
reduce()Combines all elements of an iterable into a single value using a function.
